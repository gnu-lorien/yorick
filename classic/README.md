# Quickstart with Cloud9

I've started using Cloud9 so there's also a quick start script for this.

Start up a workstation with the node.js configuration. Clone the yorick address from github https://github.com/gnu-lorien/yorick.git ~/code/yorick. Once it starts up, run the following command in the terminal:

bash ~/workspace/dotfiles/initialize_c9.bash
You'll get the webapp running on the default port and connecting to a mongodb also hosted on C9. You can also use this file to generally see how you might generate configuration for any local development.
